                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Welcome to Phone Number Generator (https://www.phonenumbergenerator.my/). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Our Core Principle: Client-Side Processing & Your Privacy</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    At Phone Number Generator, your privacy is paramount. Our core functionality is designed to be entirely client-side. This means:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or process any personal identifying information (PII) from our users.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All phone number generation requests and the resulting numbers are processed locally within your web browser. Your input and the generated output do not leave your device unless you choose to copy or export them.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>No User Accounts or Sign-ups:</strong> We do not require or offer user accounts, logins, or sign-ups, eliminating the need to collect user credentials or associated personal data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Information We Do Not Collect or Store</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    We explicitly state that we do not collect or store the following types of information:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
                    <li class="mb-1">Your IP address (for core functionality)</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">Your browser type or operating system</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">Your device information</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">Your geographic location</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">Any personal identifiers</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">The specific natural language prompts you enter for number generation</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">The generated phone numbers themselves (these stay in your browser until cleared)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. How Information (or Lack Thereof) Is Used</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Since we do not collect personal data, we do not use your information for:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
                    <li class="mb-1">Marketing or advertising (beyond general website visibility)</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">Selling to third parties</li>
                    <li class="mb-1">Profiling or tracking your behavior</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    While our core functionality is client-side, we do utilize some third-party services that may have their own privacy policies. We select these services carefully to minimize data collection.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Vercel (Hosting)</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Our website is hosted on Vercel. Vercel may collect certain standard server logs (e.g., access times, pages viewed, IP addresses) for operational purposes, security, and analytics, as is common with web hosting services. This data is handled according to Vercel's Privacy Policy. We do not directly access or store this information.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Cloudflare (DNS & Optional Proxy)</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    We use Cloudflare for DNS management. If you choose to enable Cloudflare's proxy features (orange cloud in DNS settings), Cloudflare may process traffic logs for security, performance, and analytics, subject to their Privacy Policy. While our default recommendation for direct integration with Vercel is to disable the proxy, this is within your control.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">OpenRouter (AI Model API through Vercel Functions)</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    For our natural language processing feature, your anonymized, non-personal natural language requests (e.g., "generate 10 US phone numbers") are sent to our Vercel Function, which then securely forwards them to OpenRouter's API. OpenRouter processes these requests to understand your command (e.g., identify country and quantity).
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li class="mb-1"><strong>No Personal Data Sent:</strong> We ensure that no personal data is included in the prompts sent to OpenRouter. The prompts are solely related to the number generation command.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1"><strong>OpenRouter's Policy:</strong> OpenRouter's handling of data is governed by their Privacy Policy. We act as an intermediary to securely access their service.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Ko-fi (Donations)</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    If you choose to support us through Ko-fi, your interaction, payment processing, and any personal information you provide during a donation (like your name or email if you choose to share it) are handled directly by Ko-fi and their payment processors. We do not receive or store your payment details. Ko-fi's Privacy Policy applies to these transactions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Google Analytics (Future Consideration)</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    We may consider using Google Analytics in the future to understand website traffic and user behavior in an aggregated and anonymous manner. If implemented, this will be clearly stated, and anonymization features will be used.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    We do not use first-party cookies for tracking or storing personal information.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Third-party services mentioned above (Vercel, Cloudflare, OpenRouter, Ko-fi) may use cookies or similar technologies as part of their service delivery. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for details.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Data Security</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    While we do not collect or store your personal data, we take reasonable measures to protect the integrity and security of our website and the anonymous data flow to our AI API. Our Vercel Functions act as a secure proxy to protect API keys.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Our website is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
                </p>
